NOTES:
useReducer: The useReducer Hook is the better alternative to the useState hook and is generally more preferred over the useState hook when you have complex state-building logic or when the next state value depends upon its previous value or when the components are needed to be optimized.

Step1: create inc or dec program using usestate

step2: replace usestate with use reducer 

point 1: usereducer takes 2 arguments, first is reducerfunction which says what u want to do(like inc or dec)
point 2: returns an array with 2 values. 1st is current value and displatch function
	we call them as state and dispatch. here state will hold initial value and updated once u call dispatch, it will trigger reducerfunction
