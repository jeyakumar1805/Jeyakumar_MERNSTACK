NOTES:
PROPS & STATES:
* every component will have props and states
PROPS: It won't change. Ex: name, like tata. bislery
STATES: It changes or we can change it. Ex: water lvl in bottle(initial state full, updated state half, current state empty)

STATE:

* In class component, we can change the state
*Earlier in IT industry they were using class component, in recent days the state component is not available with functional components. HOOKS is used to implement state in functional components

HOOKS: Implementation of state
	-useState
	-useRef
	-useEffect
example of useState: Counterclock, stating the initial state as zero we can increment, decrement it using useState Hook
